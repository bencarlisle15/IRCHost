SCAHost is the host server for a chat application. It is intended on being very secure but I'm a college student, not a multi-billion dollar corporation. This application is intended for learning purposes and please do not use it in security-crucial situation. If you find a vulnerability please add it to the issues page.

Associated with this server is the repo SCAClient. Feel free to make your own client in whatever language you wish using the protocols described in the wiki.

My goal is for the server to dignify all undefined input with a response. It is my current understanding that all undefined input is caught but I'm sure that will change. If you receive the status code 500, then an error occurred within the server. Please report any input or insight that you can to help understand why it happened.

For more information look at the responses protocols and requests protocols pages on the wiki.
